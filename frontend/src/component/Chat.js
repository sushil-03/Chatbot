            2.5 billion – that’s how many customer service hours businesses will
            save by 2023 through the adoption of chatbots, as estimated by
            Juniper Research. Chatbot growth, as we are aware, has been
            phenomenal across industries in the last few year.
            <br />
            <br /> Chatbots are categorized mainly into two different types :–
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong className="">1. Rule-Based Chatbots</strong>: They follow a
            set of pre-defined rules or flows to respond to queries of a user.
            Most simple applications contain rule-based chatbots, which respond
            to questions based on the preset rules. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>2. AI Chatbots</strong>: AI chatbots are more advanced and
            based on machine learning. AI chatbot uses natural language
            processing services to understand the meaning behind the questions
            posed.
